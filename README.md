# NHS Referral to Treatment (RTT) Operational Pressure Analysis – 2025

## Project Overview
This project analyses NHS England Referral to Treatment (RTT) incomplete pathway data from April 2025 to December 2025.

The objective is to transform publicly available national waiting list data into structured decision-support insights for operational pressure management.

Rather than focusing on descriptive statistics alone, this project develops an interpretable pressure model and escalation framework to support NHS operational strategy.

## Data Source

* NHS England RTT Incomplete Pathways Full Extracts  
* Monthly data: April 2025 – December 2025  
* Publicly available provider-level aggregated data  

All analysis is based exclusively on publicly published statistics.

---

## Key Metrics Analysed

* Total Waiting List Size  
* Percentage Waiting >18 Weeks  
* Percentage Waiting >52 Weeks  
* Month-on-Month Change  
* Composite Pressure Score (Normalised Indicator)  

---

## Key Findings (Apr–Dec 2025)

* National waiting list declined gradually from April to November 2025  
* >52 week waits reduced significantly toward late 2025  
* April 2025 represented peak operational pressure  
* November 2025 represented lowest pressure period in dataset  
* Certain surgical specialties show sustained long-wait concentration

## Decision-Support Framework

This project introduces:

* Pressure Score ranking model  
* Operational escalation tiers  
* Monitoring thresholds  
* Governance-aware automation boundaries  

The focus is structured decision support — not automated decision execution.

## Repository Structure

/notebooks → Full analytical workflow  
/images → Generated charts and visual outputs  

---

## Governance & Analytical Boundaries

* No patient-level identifiable data used  
* No predictive modelling deployed  
* No live operational systems connected  
* Designed for decision-support context only  

The analysis prioritises interpretability, auditability, and responsible automation principles.
